#The internet was VERY against this (data dredging), plus it seemed tedious AF

##multiple least squares: ORIGINAL DATA (termstart,chamber,party,state)
#note that this checks each state individually (and some of them are significant, which is weird)
lm.fit.og <- lm(age~termstart+chamber+party+state, data=congress) #r2 = 0.08795

##multiple least squares: FULL DATA 
#below found that in this model, GDP is significant at highest level but nothing else is if you use an alpha of 0.05
#probably just leave them out
lm.fit.full <- lm(age~., data=congress) #r2 = 0.1814, but the improvement prolly just due to inclusion of variables

##multiple least squares: STUFF THAT LOOKED IMPORTANT (termstart,chamber,party,state,gdp)
#let's call this the best dataset
lm.fit.important <- lm(age~termstart+chamber+party+state+GDP, data=congress) #r2 = 0.1074

#INTERACTIONS:
#I kind of suggest that we don't do this. I don't think it really makes any sense.

#NONLINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS
lm.transformation <- lm(age~termstart+chamber+party+state+GDP+log(GDP), data=congress) #r2 = 0.1086 (made it slightly better)
anova(lm.fit.important,lm.transformation) #f-statistic = 19.149, p-value is near 0, suggesting that by adding the log term, we can improve the fit.

lm.poly <- lm(age~termstart+chamber+party+state+GDP+poly(GDP,5), data=congress) #all of the terms (2-5) are significant?, w/ r2 = 0.1107
#the above fit is better but the improvement might just be due to the fact that we added 5 more variables.

#CONCLUSION:
#I would suggest going with predicting age based off termstart, chamber, party, state, and GDP for the sake of parsimony.
