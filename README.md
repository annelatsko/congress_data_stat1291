# congress_data_stat1291
Repo for group project for stat 1291, using congress data from FiveThirtyEight's Github repo

## Weird stuff with the data:
There was some weird stuff with the data that was obtained from FiveThirtyEight, specifically, there were some people who had their suffix and their last name in the opposite position. It is resolved in both the dirty_data/OG_congress-terms.csv and clean_data/congress-terms.csv. The congress-terms.csv that's not in clean_data is the original file I downloaded with no changes.
