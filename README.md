# congress_data_stat1291
Repo for group project for stat 1291, using congress data from FiveThirtyEight's Github repo

There was some weird stuff with the data that was obtained from FiveThirtyEight, specifically, there were some people who had their suffix and their last name in the opposite position and there were some people who had 2 political parties. In the latter case, I defaulted to just R or D (whichever they had) after researching their regular party (their second party was weird stuff, like the Nebraska Party (NE).
